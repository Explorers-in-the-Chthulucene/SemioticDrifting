    "# Ontology design\n",

    "According to the Knowledge Extraction performed on the text we designed two ontologies to represent different layers of abstractions.\n",
    "\n",
    "They are concieved to be mapped through the owl property <b>sameAs</b> when an instance of a concept is found by parsing the text, allowing to connect semantic text-tied information at a sentence level with a more broader understanding of Haraway's theory, in a process that unfolds from the particular to the general and is able to give a comprehensive overview of how Entities, their roles and the conceptual knowledge they convey are related to each other as well as hinting at how Haraway style of writing works on a textual level."

    "\n",
    "This Ontology is designed to represent the content of the text at a theoretical level. Starting from topic modeling and our understanding of <i>Staying with the trouble</i>'s Chapter 7, we created an Ontology to connect meaningful extracted Concepts between them, highlighting their interconnectedness and relations.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Extracted Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "* Becoming-with\n",
    "* Go-visit\n",
    "* Inheritance\n",
    "* Ongoingness\n",
    "* Playing SF\n",
    "* Politeness\n",
    "* Render-capable\n",
    "* Response-ability\n",
    "* Storytelling\n",
    "* Think-from\n",
    "* Think-with\n",
    "* Worlding\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "The extracted individuals where grouped in three classes, that have a general <b>Concept</b> class as Superclass:\n",
    "\n",
    "* ActivityConcept: ActivityConcepts are situated, concrete processes actuated by and through the beings -human and not-  that participate in them. They are re-inventions of common activities such as \"thinking\", \"becoming\" in the non-anthropocentric frame of the Chthulucene and they usually require equal co-participation of all entities involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "* PracticeConcept: A PracticeConcept identifies general practices described by DonnaHaraway these practices are general conceptual frames to understand and act in a troubled word and may manifest in different situated examples. They are considered at an abstract level and explained through original evocative terms such as \"SF\", \"Worlding\", \"Ongoingness\".\n",
    "\n",
    "* ModeConcept: ModeConcepts are ways of doing things, a particular state of mind and predisposition that is necessary for enabling an ActivityConcept or a PracticeConcept. For example, Donna Haraway defines Politeness as a virtue that makes the activity of thinking-with a generative activity, really capable of transforming the beings that participate in it. In other words, Politeness is the modality of thinking that transform \"think\" in \"think-with\".\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Properties\n",
    "\n",
    "We established the relationships between Concepts by interpreting Donna Haraway's theory and created a conceptual map (<a herf=\"\">here</a>).\n",
    "\n",
    "These are our final <b>objectProperties</b>:\n",
    "\n",
    "* exampleOf: connects a Concept that is an example of anothe Concept (similar to skos:broader)\n",
    "* hasExample: inverse of exampleOf\n",
    "* generatedBy: connects a Concept that is the result of the actuation of another Concept\n",
    "* generates: the inverse of generatedBy\n",
    "* hasCondition: connects a Concept to a <b>ModeConcept</b> that is the condition for the actuation of the domain Concept.\n",
    "* impliesActivity: connects a Concept to a <b>ActivityConcept</b> that is implied in the actuation of the domain Concept\n",
    "* impliedIn: inverse of impliesActivity\n",
    "* overlapsWith: a symmetrical property connecting two Concepts whose meaning overlaps\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Competency Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "We designed some Competency questions to be able to evaluate the fulfillment of our ontology requirements by meand of SPARQL queries on the Knowledge Graph:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Which Practice implies the activity of thinking-with?\n",
    "2. Which concepts generate other concepts? What are these other concepts?\n",
    "3. What are the concepts that whose meaning overlap?\n",
    "4. Which Concepts are activities?\n",
    "5. Which Concepts are Practices\n",
    "6. Which Concepts have a condition? and what is the condition?\n",
    "7. What does Playing String Figures concept overlaps with?\n",
    "\n",
    "Expected results:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. To go visit\n",
    "2. to become-with generates ongoingness\n",
    "3. to become-with and to render-capable, storytelling and playing String Figures, Inheritance and Storytelling\n",
    "4. to become-with, Playing SF, to render-capable, Storytelling, tho think-from, to think-with\n",
    "5. to go-visit, Inheritance, Ongoingness, Worlding\n",

    "### ChthuluGraph\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting from Frame semantics, we aimed to be able to connect our extracted Entities with their semantic roles in each sentence, in order to anna layer of undertanding of entities relationships in a context, as well as understanding better what types of entities could cover which role, given that Donna Haraway especially adopts a <b>non-anthropocentric view</b> and focuses on the importance of <b>multispecies collaboration</b> as well as the centrality of <b>situating knowledge</b>, namely expliciting from what position a being produces knowledge, or in Haraway's terms \"what thoughts think other thoughts\".\n",
    "\n",
    "this is our <a href=\"\">conceptual map</a>\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "To do so we identified for main classes to group different types of Frame Arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "* AgentiveEntity\n",
    "* Concept\n",
    "* Descriptor\n",
    "* Place\n",
    "\n",
    "Each classes has several subclasses, adding more detailed classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "for example, <b>AgentiveEntity</b> has subclasses \n",
    "\n",
    "* Animated\n",
    "* Innimated\n",
    "\n",
    "and <b>Animated</b> has subclasses \n",
    "\n",
    "* Animal\n",
    "* HumanComm: human beings identified with common nouns, such as \"breeders\"\n",
    "* HumanProp: people identified with their proper noun, such as \"Hannah Arendt\"\n",
    "* Organization\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, at the lower classes level, <b>every Named Entity extracted from the text is a Class on its own</b>, given that, by parsing the text, <b>several instances of the same classes can be found</b>. \n",
    "\n",
    "Morover, we created two other classes\n",
    "\n",
    "* Frame\n",
    "* Role \n",
    "\n",
    "They both have as subclasses all the Frames and Roles we manually annotated in the first paragraph of Chapter 7, and would need to be expanded if considering the whole text. However, this is a very time consuming task to do manually, it could be done by exploiting FRED framenet alignment, for example, but automating such a step was out of the scope of this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "So far these are the Frame subclasses extracted from the first paragraph and present in our ontology:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Being_in_category\n",

    "* Needing\n",
    "* People_by_vocation\n",
    "* Perception_active\n",
    "* Studying\n",
    "\n",
    "The same line of reasoning was applied for creating 22 Role subclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Properties\n",
    "\n",
    "* evokes: property connecting a Frame to the Concepts, if present, evoked in the text.\n",
    "* isEvokedBy: inverse of evokes\n",
    "* involvesRole: Property connecting a frame to its Frame Elements (hence, the sematic roles identified in a Frame).\n",
    "\n",
    "to connect arguments to their Role in a Frame and sdisambiguating what types of Entity are involved we created four <b>sub properties</b> of <b>hasRole</b>:\n",
    "\n",
    "* agentiveRole: Property connecting an AgentiveEntity to the Role it assumes in a Frame\n",
    "* conceptRole: Property connecting a Cpncept to the Role it assumes in a Frame\n",
    "* descriptorRole: Pproperty connecting a Descriptor to the Role it assumes in a Frame\n",
    "* locationRole: Property connecting a Location to the Role it assumes in a Frame\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Competency Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "We designed some Competency questions to be able to evaluate the fulfillment of our ontology requirements by meand of SPARQL queries on the Knowledge Graph:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What are the identified Frames in the first paragraph?\n",
    "2. Quali sono i ruoli sono riconosciuti per il Frame Cause Expansion?\n",
    "3. Quali ruoli ricopre Vinciane Despret? In quali frames?\n",
    "4. What instances co-occur in the same frame?\n",
    "5. Quali sono i ruoli di ogni riconosciunti in ogni Frame?\n",
    "6. Che ruolo ricoprono, a prescindere dal frame, tutti i concetti di tipo ActivityConcept?\n",

    "Expected results:\n",
