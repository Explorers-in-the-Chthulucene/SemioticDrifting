PHRASES:
- She studies how beings render each other capable in actual encounters, and she theorizes —makes cogently available— that kind of theory and method. 
-Her kind of thinking enlarges, even invents, the competencies of all the players, including herself, such that the domain of ways of being and knowing dilates, expands, adds both ontological and epistemological possibilities, proposes and enacts what was not there before.
- What scientists actually do in the field affects the ways “animals see their scientists seeing them” and therefore how the animals respond.
-In a strong sense, observers and birds rendered each other capable in ways not written into preexisting scripts, but invented or provoked, more than simply shown, in practical research.
-  Birds and scientists were in dynamic, moving relations of attunement. The behavior of birds and their observers were made, but not made up.

Politeness (a particular epistemological position to which I am committed, one that I call a virtue. It does the energetic work of holding open the possibility that surprises are in store, that something interesting is about to happen)
	virtue
	cultivation
	curious practice
	a modality of go visiting
	risky

ResponseAbility (training the mind and imagination to go visiting, to venture off the beaten path to meet unexpected, non-natal kin, and to strike up conversations, to pose and respond to interesting questions, to propose together something unanticipated, to take up the unasked-for obligations 
of having met.)

	
Ongoingness
	the idea of a world that could be habitable
	practices activating storytelling
	living and dying well with each other
	MultispeciesFlourishing
	opening up versions
		
GoVisiting (is a worlding practice that entails the act of "thinking-with" other beings. if done with "politeness" it holds open the possibility of unexpected consequences generated by a mutual transformation of the parties involved: they "become-with" each other in "response-ability" -as in the string figure metaphor, they respond to the questions the other evokes in a perpetuous exchange of relational responsabilty" (here concepts of inheritance and thinking from. Because ultimetely, we have been playing string figures in the past (it matters what thoughts think thoughts) we need to be disloyal to learned doctrines -, "rendering each other capable" of "ongoingness", namely "living and dying" well in a troubled thick present)
	engaging
	inquiring
	observing

Worlding (worlding is a practice specific to the Chthulucene, that implys a curious, tentacular and non univocal or linear, displacement to entail a relationship with other beings, human and not, and therefore generate stories.)
