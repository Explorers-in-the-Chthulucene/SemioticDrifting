						<h3>Donna Haraway influences upon other schools of thought</h3>
						<p>Donna Haraway and Bruno Latour, two prominent figures in the fields of philosophy and science studies, have made significant contributions to our understanding of the complex interplay between science, technology, society, and the environment. Their work has challenged traditional boundaries, reimagined our relationship with the non-human world, and paved the way for novel conceptualizations of knowledge and agency.

							Donna Haraway, with her influential works such as "A Cyborg Manifesto" and "Simians, Cyborgs, and Women," has pioneered the field of cyborgology and feminist theory. She proposes an alternative understanding of the human body, emphasizing its hybrid nature as a combination of biological, technological, and cultural elements. Haraway challenges the conventional dichotomies between nature and culture, human and non-human, and questions the fixed boundaries that have traditionally defined our understanding of identity and embodiment.
							
							Bruno Latour, on the other hand, is renowned for his theories on actor-network theory (ANT) and his critique of modernity. Latour argues that knowledge and agency are not exclusive to humans but are distributed across a network of human and non-human actors. He emphasizes the interconnectedness of humans, technologies, institutions, and the natural world, challenging the notion of a clear separation between nature and society. Latour's work invites us to recognize the agency and influence of non-human entities, urging us to engage with a more relational and holistic understanding of our world.
							
							While both Haraway and Latour explore similar themes, they approach them from different angles and with distinct emphases. Haraway's work often centers on feminist perspectives, emphasizing issues of gender, embodiment, and the reimagining of human and non-human relationships. In contrast, Latour's focus is more broadly on the interplay between science, technology, society, and the environment, examining the intricate webs of actors and agencies that shape our understanding of the world.
							
							Their work has inspired interdisciplinary collaborations and sparked fruitful dialogues across various fields, including philosophy, sociology, science studies, and environmental studies. Haraway and Latour have influenced generations of scholars, challenging them to question established categories, explore new conceptual frameworks, and engage with the complexities of our technoscientific and interconnected world.
							
							Through their respective contributions, Donna Haraway and Bruno Latour have enriched our understanding of the entanglements between humans, technologies, and the non-human world. Their thought-provoking ideas continue to shape contemporary discourse and offer valuable insights for navigating the challenges and possibilities of our rapidly changing societies.</p>

								<h3>Goal Identification</h3>
								<p>The very first creative brief for this website has been thought with a varied and heterogeneous community/user personas in mind. In this sense, the main objective has been to reach as many people as possible interested in Haraway production's main points. Nevertheless, being the website hosted in Github, we knew from the beginning that this could have been a project relying more on the word of mouth than the SEO itself. The realization of the work, from content management to ontology modelling, has been finalizaed for the exam in Knowledge Representation and Extraction at University of Bologna. 
									After gathering the requirements and making the proposal to professor Gangemi [lik somewhere], we decided to extend this digital environment, making it appealing not only from a technical point of view, with detailed insights about the workflow process for the ontology modelling and knowledge graph creation [link], 
									but also to provide a catchy user flow for the one interested in Donna Haraway's legacy.</p>
								<h3>Scope definition</h3>
								<p>A final asset of reusable coding snippets presented as easter eggs and theoretical frameworks has been provided for the ones who want to try their first ontology modelling. 
								<h3>Gannt Chart</h3>
								<p>[vedi <a href="https://www.teamgantt.com/design-and-creative-templates/website-design-templates"> qui </a> The project is born quite easily and in relative limited timescales. The process we adopted is hence described: 
								<ul>
									<li>Sitemap and wireframe creation</li>
									<li>Content creation</li>
									<li>Visual elements</li>
									<li>Testing</li>
								</ul>
