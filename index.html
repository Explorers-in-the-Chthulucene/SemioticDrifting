							Haraway's philosophy transcends intellectual novelty, reaching into the realm of practical
							implications that resound with transformative potential. Her groundbreaking work shatters
							the confines of conventional thought, urging us to reimagine our relationships with the
							myriad non-human beings who share our planet. By nurturing a sense of ecological
							responsibility and ethical engagement, Haraway's philosophy challenges dominant power
							structures and calls for multispecies solidarity. Her resonant voice echoes through
							contemporary debates on social justice, environmental ethics, and the urgent imperative of
							sustainable coexistence.

							As we venture into the captivating tapestry of ideas woven within Chapter 7 of "Staying with
							the Trouble," we embark on a profound journey of unlearning, reevaluation, and
							reorientation. Haraway's visionary thinking beckons us to discard our preconceived notions
							and embrace a paradigm shift that transcends anthropocentrism. Through her incisive prose,
							we are compelled to forge new alliances, to grapple with the complexities of our entangled
							existence, and to confront the pressing issues of our time with unwavering intellectual
							rigor, boundless empathy, and an unyielding commitment to the flourishing of all beings.</a>

																id="keywords">thinks-with</a> other beings, human and
															not. That is a rare and precious vocation. Vocation:
															calling, calling with, called by, calling as if the world
															mattered, calling out, going too far, going visiting.
															Despret listened to a singing blackbird one morning—a living
															blackbird outside her particular window—and that way learned
															what importance sounds like. She thinks in attunement with
															those she thinks with—recursively, inventively,
															relentlessly—with joy and verve. She studies how beings
															render each other capable in actual encounters, and she
															theorizes— makes cogently available—that kind of theory and
															method. Despret is not interested in thinking by discovering
															the stupidities of others, or by reducing the field of
															attention to prove a point. Her kind of thinking enlarges,
															even invents, the competencies of all the players, including
															herself, such that the domain of ways of being and knowing
															dilates, expands, adds both ontological and epistemological
															possibilities, proposes and enacts what was not there
															before. That is her worlding practice. She is a philosopher
															and a scientist who is allergic to denunciation and hungry
															for discovery, needy for what must be known and built
															together, with and for earthly beings, living, dead, and yet
															to come. Referring both to her own practice for observing
															scientists and also to the practices of ethologist Thelma
															Rowell observing her Soay sheep, Despret affirmed “a
															particular epistemological position to which I am committed,
															one that I call a virtue: the virtue of politeness.” In
															every sense, Despret’s cultivation of politeness is a
															curious practice. She trains her whole being, not just her
															imagination, in Arendt’s words, “to go visiting.” Visiting
															is not an easy practice; it demands the ability to find
															others actively interesting, even or especially others most
															people already claim to know all too completely, to ask
															questions that one’s interlocutors truly find interesting,
															to cultivate the wild virtue of curiosity, to retune one’s
															ability to sense and respond—and to do all this politely!
															What is this sort of politeness? It sounds more than a
															little risky. Curiosity always leads its practitioners a bit
															too far off the path, and that way lie stories. The first
															and most important thing at risk in Despret’s practice is an
															approach that assumes that beings have pre-established
															natures and abilities that are simply put into play in an
															encounter. Rather, Despret’s sort of politeness does the
															energetic work of holding open the possibility that
															surprises are in store, that something interesting is about
															to happen, but only if one cultivates the virtue of letting
															those one visits intra-actively shape what occurs. They are
															not who/what we expected to visit, and we are not who/what
															were anticipated either. Visiting is a subjectand
															object-making dance, and the choreographer is a trickster.
															Asking questions comes to mean both asking what another
															finds intriguing and also how learning to engage that
															changes everybody in unforeseeable ways. Good questions come
															only to a polite inquirer, especially a polite inquirer
															provoked by a singing blackbird. With good questions, even
															or especially mistakes and misunderstandings can become
															interesting. This is not so much a question of manners, but
															of epistemology and ontology, and of method alert to
															off-the-beaten-path practices. At the least, this sort of
															politeness is not what Miss Manners purveys in her advice
															column. There are so many examples of Despret learning and
															teaching polite inquiry. Perhaps the most famous is her
															visit to the Negev desert field site of the Israeli
															ornithologist Amotz Zahavi, where she encountered Arabian
															babblers who defied orthodox accounts of what birds should
															be doing, even as the scientists also acted off-script
															scientifically. Specifically, Zahavi asked in excruciating
															detail, what matters to babblers? He could not do good
															science otherwise. The babblers’ practices of altruism were
															off the charts, and they seemed to do it, according to
															Zahavi, for reasons of competitive prestige not well
															accounted for by theories like kin selection. Zahavi let the
															babblers be interesting; he asked them interesting
															questions; he saw them dance. “Not only were these birds
															described as dancing together in the morning sunrise, not
															only were they eager to offer presents to one another, not
															only would they take pride in caring for each other’s
															nestlings or in defending an endangered comrade, but also,
															according to Zahavi’s depiction, their relations relied on
															trust.” What Despret tells us she came to know is that the
															specific practices of observation, narration, and the
															liveliness of the birds were far from independent of each
															other. This was not just a question of worldviews and
															related theories shaping research design and
															interpretations, or of any other purely discursive effect.
															What scientists actually do in the field affects the ways
															“animals see their scientists seeing them” and therefore how
															the animals respond. In a strong sense, observers and birds
															rendered each other capable in ways not written into
															preexisting scripts, but invented or provoked, more than
															simply shown, in practical research. Birds and scientists
															were in dynamic, moving relations of attunement. The
															behavior of birds and their observers were made, but not
															made up. Stories are essential, but are never “mere”
															stories. Zahavi seemed intent on making experiments with
															rather than on babblers. He was trying to look at the world
															with the babblers rather than at them, a very demanding
															practice. And the same demands were made of Despret, who
															came to watch scientists but ended up in a much more complex
															tangle of practices. Birds and scientists do something, and
															they do it together. They become-with each other. The world
															in the southern Israeli desert was composed by adding
															competencies to engage competencies, adding perspectives to
															engage perspectives, adding subjectivities to engage
															subjectivities, adding versions to understand versions. In
															short, this science worked by addition, not subtraction.
															Worlds enlarged; the babblers and the scientists— Despret
															included—inhabited a world of propositions not available
															before. “Both humans and babblers create narratives, rather
															than just telling them. They create/disclose new scripts.”
															Good questions were posed; surprising answers made the world
															richer. Visiting might be risky, but it is definitely not
															boring. Despret’s work is full of literal collaborations,
															with people and with animals, not simply metaphors of
															thinking with each other. I admit I am drawn most by the
															collaborations that entangle people, critters, and
															apparatuses. No wonder that Despret’s work with sociologist
															Jocelyne Porcher and the farmers, pigs, and cows in their
															care sustains me. Despret and Porcher visited cow and pig
															breeders on nonindustrial French farms, where the humans and
															animals lived in daily interaction that led sober,
															nonromantic, working breeders to say such things as, “We
															don’t stop talking with our animals.” The question that led
															Despret and Porcher to the farmers circled around their
															efforts to think through what it means to claim that these
															domestic food-producing animals are working, and working
															with their people. The first difficulty, not surprisingly,
															was to figure out how to ask questions that interested the
															breeders, that engaged them in their conversations and
															labors with their animals. It was decidedly not interesting
															to the breeders to ask how animals and people are the same
															or different in general. These are people who make
															particular animals live and die and who live, and die, by
															them. The task was to engage these breeders in constructing
															the questions that mattered to them. The breeders
															incessantly “uprooted” the researchers’ questions to address
															the queries that concerned them in their work. The story has
															many turns, but what interested me most was the insistence
															of the breeders that their animals “know what we want, but
															we, we don’t know what they want.” Figuring out what their
															animals want, so that people and cows could together
															accomplish successful breeding, was the fundamental
															conjoined work of the farm. Farmers bad at listening to
															their animals, bad at talking to them, and bad at responding
															were not good farmers in their peers’ estimation. The
															animals paid attention to their farmers; paying equally
															effective attention to the cows and pigs was the job of good
															breeders. This is an extension of subjectivities for both
															people and critters, “becoming what the other suggests to
															you, accepting a proposal of subjectivity, acting in the
															manner in which the other addresses you, actualizing and
															verifying this proposal, in the sense of rendering it true.”
															The result is bringing into being animals that nourish
															humans, and humans that nourish animals. Living and dying
															are both in play. “Working together” in this kind of daily
															interaction of labor, conversation, and attention seems to
															me to be the right idiom. Continually hungry for more of
															Despret’s visiting with critters, their people, and their
															apparatuses—hungry for more of her elucidations of
															“anthropo-zoo-genesis” —I have a hard time feeling satisfied
															with only human people on the menu. That prejudice took a
															tumble when I read Women Who Make a Fuss: The Unfaithful
															Daughters of Virginia Woolf, which Isabelle Stengers and
															Vinciane Despret wrote together with an extraordinary
															collective of bumptious women. “Think we must!” cries this
															book, in concert with the famous line from Virginia Woolf’s
															Three Guineas. In Western worlds, and elsewhere too, women
															have hardly been included in the patrilines of thinking,
															most certainly including the patrilines making decisions for
															(yet another) war. Why should Virginia Woolf, or any other
															woman, or men for that matter, be faithful to such
															patrilines and their demands for sacrifice? Infidelity seems
															the least we should demand of ourselves! This all matters,
															but the question in this book is not precisely that, but
															rather what thinking can possibly mean in the civilization
															in which we find ourselves. “But how do we take back up a
															collective adventure that is multiple and ceaselessly
															reinvented, not on an individual basis, but in a way that
															passes the baton, that is to say, affirms new givens and new
															unknowns?” We must somehow make the relay, inherit the
															trouble, and reinvent the conditions for multispecies
															flourishing, not just in a time of ceaseless human wars and
															genocides, but in a time of humanpropelled mass extinctions
															and multispecies genocides that sweep people and critters
															into the vortex. We must “dare ‘to make’ the relay; that is
															to create, to fabulate, in order not to despair. In order to
															induce a transformation, perhaps, but without the artificial
															loyalty that would resemble ‘in the name of a cause,’ no
															matter how noble it might be.” Hannah Arendt and Virginia
															Woolf both understood the high stakes of training the mind
															and imagination to go visiting, to venture off the beaten
															path to meet unexpected, non-natal kin, and to strike up
															conversations, to pose and respond to interesting questions,
															to propose together something unanticipated, to take up the
															unasked-for obligations of having met. This is what I have
															called cultivating response-ability. Visiting is not a
															heroic practice; making a fuss is not the Revolution;
															thinking with each other is not Thought. Opening up versions
															so stories can be ongoing is so mundane, so earth-bound.
															That is precisely the point. The blackbird sings its
															importance; the babblers dance their shining prestige; the
															storytellers crack the established disorder. That is what
															“going too far” means, and this curious practice is not
															safe. Like Arendt and Woolf, Despret and her collaborators
															understand that we are dealing with “the idea of a world
															that could be habitable.” “The very strength of women who
															make a fuss is not to represent the True, rather to be
															witnesses for the possibility of other ways of doing what
															would perhaps be ‘better.’ The fuss is not the heroic
															statement of a grand cause . . . It instead affirms the need
															to resist the stifling impotence created by the ‘no
															possibility to do otherwise, whether we want it or not,’
															which now reigns everywhere.” It is past time to make such a
															fuss. Despret’s curious practice has no truck with loyalty
															to a cause or doctrine; but it draws deeply from another
															virtue that is sometimes confused with loyalty, namely,
															“thinking from” a heritage. She is tuned to the obligations
															that inhere in starting from situated histories, situated
															stories. She retells the parable of the twelve camels in
															order to tease out what it means to “start from,” that is,
															to “remain obligated with respect to that from which we
															speak, think, or act. It means to let ourselves learn from
															the event and to create from it.” In a sort of cat’s cradle
															with powerful fables, Despret received the parable from
															Isabelle Stengers, and then she relayed it to me in early .
															I relay it back to her here. To inherit is an act “which
															demands thought and commitment. An act that calls for our
															transformation by the very deed of inheriting.” In his will,
															the father in this story left his three quarrelsome sons a
															seemingly impossible inheritance: eleven camels to be
															divided in a precise way, half to the eldest son, a quarter
															to the second son, and a sixth to the third. The perverse
															requirements of the legacy provoked the confused sons, who
															were on the verge of failing to fulfill the terms of the
															will, to visit an old man living in the village. His savvy
															kindness in giving the sons a twelfth camel allowed the
															heirs to create a solution to their difficult heritage; they
															could make their inheritance active, alive, generative. With
															twelve camels, the fractions worked, and there was one camel
															left over to give back to the old man. Despret notes that
															the tale she read left actual camels out of the enlargement
															and creativity of finding what it means to “start from.”
															Those storied camels were conventional, discursive, figural
															beasts, whose only function was to give occasion for the
															problematic sons to grow in patriarchal understanding,
															recapitulating more than a little the history of philosophy
															that Despret—and I—inherited. But by listening, telling, and
															activating that particular story her way, she makes
															something that was absent present. She made an interesting,
															curious fuss without denouncing anybody. Therefore, another
															heritage emerges and makes claims on anyone listening,
															anyone attuned. It isn’t just philosophy that has to change;
															the mortal world shifts. Long-legged, big-lipped, humped
															camels shake the dust from their hot, hard-worked hides and
															nuzzle the storyteller for a scratch behind the ears.
															Despret, and because of her, we, inherit camels now, camels
															with their people, in their markets and places of travel and
															labor, in their living and dying in worlds-at-stake, like
															the contemporary Gobi Desert. We start from what is
															henceforth a dilated story that makes unexpected demands to
															cultivate response-ability. If we are to remain faithful to
															starting from the transformed story, we can no longer not
															know or not care that camels and people are at stake to each
															other—across regions, genders, races, species, practices.
															From now on, call that philosophy, a game of cat’s cradle,
															not a lineage. We are obligated to speak from situated
															worlds, but we no longer need start from a humanist
															patriline and its breath-taking erasures and high-wire acts.
															The risk of listening to a story is that it can obligate us
															in ramifying webs that cannot be known in advance of
															venturing among their myriad threads. In a world of
															anthropozoogenesis, the figural is more likely than not to
															grow teeth and bite us in the bum. Despret’s philosophical
															ethology starts from the dead and missing as well as from
															the living and visible. She has studied situated human
															beings’ mourning practices for their dead in ways strongly
															akin to her practice of philosophical ethology; in both
															domains, she attends to how—in practice—people can and do
															solicit the absent into vivid copresence, in many kinds of
															temporality and materiality. She attends to how practices—
															activated storytelling—can be on the side of what I call
															“ongoingness”: that is, nurturing, or inventing, or
															discovering, or somehow cobbling together ways for living
															and dying well with each other in the tissues of an earth
															whose very habitability is threatened. Many kinds of failure
															of ongoingness crumble lifeways in our times of onrushing
															extinctions, exterminations, wars, extractions, and
															genocides. Many kinds of absence, or threatened absence,
															must be brought into ongoing response-ability, not in the
															abstract but in homely storied cultivated practice. To my
															initial surprise, this matter brought Despret and me
															together with racing pigeons, also called carrier pigeons
															(in French voyageurs) and with their avid fanciers (in
															French colombophiles, lovers of pigeons). I wrote an essay
															for Despret after an extraordinary week with her and her
															colleagues in the chateau at Cerisy in July , in which I
															proposed playing string figure games with companion species
															for cultivating multispecies response-ability. I sent
															Despret a draft containing my discussion of the wonderful
															art-technology-environmental-activist project by Beatriz da
															Costa called PigeonBlog, as well as a discussion of the
															communities of racing pigeons and their fanciers in Southern
															California. Pigeon racing is a working-class men’s sport
															around the world, one made immensely difficult in conditions
															of urban war (Baghdad, Damascus), racial and economic
															injustice (New York, Berlin), and displaced labor and play
															of many kinds across regions (France, Iran, California). I
															care about art-design-activist practices that join diverse
															people and varied critters in shared, often vexed public
															spaces. “Starting from” this caring, not from some
															delusional caring in general, landed me in innovative pigeon
															lofts, where, it turned out, Despret, attuned to practices
															of commemoration, had already begun to roost. In particular,
															by leading me to Matali Crasset’s Capsule, built in in the
															leisure park of Caudry, she shared her understanding of the
															power of holding open actual space for ongoing living and
															working in the face of threatened absence as a potent
															practice of commemoration. The Beauvois association of
															carrier pigeon fanciers asked Crasset, an artist and
															industrial designer, to build a prototype pigeon loft that
															would combine beauty, functionality for people and birds,
															and a pedagogic lure to draw future practitioners into
															learning demanding skills. Actual pigeons had to thrive
															inhabiting this loft; actual colombophiles had to experience
															the loft working; and actual visitors to the ecological
															park, which was rehabilitating exhausted farmland into a
															variegated nature reserve for recuperating critters and
															people, had to be infected with the desire for a life
															transformed with avian voyageurs. Despret understood that
															the prototype, the memorial, had to be for both the carrier
															pigeons and their people—past, present and yet to come.
															Neither the critters nor the people could have existed or
															could endure without each other in ongoing, curious
															practices. Attached to ongoing pasts, they bring each other
															forward in thick presents and still possible futures; they
															stay with the trouble in speculative fabulation.

											put it, this ontology aims at playing string figures and entangle different

							<code>Place</code> <br> Each classes has several subclasses, adding more detailed

							<code>Frame </code> <br>
							<code>Role </code> <br> They both have as subclasses all the Frames and Roles we manually

							<h3>Critique and further enhancements</h3>
							With the present work we have faced to the problem of modeling different instances of the same entity in a way that could
							allow us to retrieve their semantic role and their co occurrence at a sentence level in a long text. 
							The solution we came up with, even though accounting in a complete way for the identification of roles and types of entity, as well as 
							defining meaningful relationships between semantic roles in frames and their conceptual meaning in Haraway's world, could definetely be improved.<br>
							The main flaw of our model is its redundancy, since, instead of having a single individual that participates in different situations (is found in multiple sentences across the text), 
							we created a Class for every entity and as many individuals of that class as encountered in the text (ex. "she", "who", "Desprets" are all different individuals of the class Viniciane_Despret).
							This solution, beside its extensive and redundant nature, could also be criticized logically, in so far as, only one individual "Viniciane Despret" exists and it that same individual that manifests itself in
							multiple occasions throughout the text.<br>
							As further enhancement, we propose to take inspiration from <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225119791_Understanding_the_Semantic_Web_through_Descriptions_and_Situations">Situation ontology design pattern</a> to rework
							on ChthuluGraph and improve the ontology.
